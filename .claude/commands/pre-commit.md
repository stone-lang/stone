description: Pre-commit checks: verify tests, coverage, and suggest commit message
---

Before I make a commit:

1. Make sure there are no errors, especially for corner cases.
2. Make sure we have appropriate test coverage for the staged code.
3. Check for refactoring/cleanup opportunities in the code (and tests, docs, etc) being staged
3. Verify tests pass (for the code that will be committed)
4. Show me what's staged (or a summary)
5. Suggest a commit message
